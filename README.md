Assignment 7
Author: Chris Butler

Bugs:
    Nico found a neat technique where you fall off and then jump to get back
        onto the platform. If practiced you could hide along an edge and they
        will all jump to their deaths like lemmings.
        In practice, though, it's hard to get working more than two or three
        times in a row.

Features:

    Run from the demon spheres!
        They spawn everytime their numbers dwindle too much, but otherwise spawn in
    pairs. You can see where they're heading with their snouts (kinda look
    like cubes).
        Be careful though! They don't move towards your location, but rather
    where you'll be *in 10 frames*. This makes them much harder to fool.

    If they collide, they die. If you collide, YOU die!
    Your highscore is printed to the screen.
